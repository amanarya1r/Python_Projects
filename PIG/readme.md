# PIG

## How does PIG works:
It is a multiplayer dice game, a player get a turn during that turn they roll the dice, when dice rolled a player gets a number, if a player get any thing other than 1 you take that and add that to the score of your turn and a user can decide how many times you want to roll the dice.
But the thing is if a user get 1 there previous score becomes zero. So every time a user is gambling there will be a possibility of losing the score a user can roll the dice as many times as possible unless 1 on dice never appear. 
Rolling the dice is a user choice and how many times he want to roll the dice also depend upon the user.

## Mechanism points for PIG
    1. Allowing user to roll the dice [user roll and got number depending random number generator from 1 to 6]
    2. Asking user if they want to continue to roll or stop there turn 
    3. If they stop there turn there score get added to there respective score variable
    4. if score variable reaches or above than 50 then that user become winner of that game
